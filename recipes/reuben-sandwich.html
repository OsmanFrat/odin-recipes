    <h2>What Is a Reuben Sandwich?</h2>
    <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu
    <br> staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines
    meat and cheese.</p>

        <br>Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
